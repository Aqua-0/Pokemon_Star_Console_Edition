# Info #


This file contains all the information I have on Pokemon Star: Luma Edition.


10/9/2020, 11:14 AM: Created info file. Will try to do more later when school's done. Until then, signing off.

10/10/2020, 9:15 AM: Don't have any word or patch files from the creator. Hope it comes soon. Also trying to figure out why a/0/8/3 garc doesn't like console. Some people say that it's incorrectly encrypted, others say that it simply has so much going on that it causes the game to crash.

10/10/2020, 1:40 PM: I have a theory that if I get the romfs folder from a non-trimmed version of the Pokemon Star rom, it may work. I'll post later with the results...

10/10/2020, 5:17 PM: Armageddon ensued while I was trying to get romfs from a non-trimmed version. The thing is: The rom was strangely just 1 byte too long to move to 3DS. I tried getting romfs from a trimmed version and PROGRESS! Instead of getting an arm11 exception, I got an infinite grey screen. Let's see if I can shrink a file by just 1 byte without trimming it...

10/13/2020, 3:42 PM: Was able to shrink a Pokemon Star rom by one byte. However, I still got that infinite grey screen. Maybe if I find a guide somewhere of how to patch the game from before the patch version was taken down, I could make a breakthrough...
